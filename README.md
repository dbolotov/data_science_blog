# Data Science Blog

This repository contains code and analysis for a set of data science projects focused on modeling, visualization, and signal processing.

I write about the projects on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dmitriy.bolotov), and keep everything organized on [dbolotov.github.io](dbolotov.github.io).


## Projects
- **Time Series Smoothing Methods: an Interactive Visualizer**: Streamlit app for comparing smoothing techniques on noisy time series data. [Streamlit app](https://timeseriessmoothing.streamlit.app/)
- **The Thermal Decay of Beverages: A Casual Overanalysis** üçµ: Real data and Newton‚Äôs Law of Cooling to compare how mugs lose heat over time. [Jupyter notebook](thermal_decay_of_beverages/thermal_decay_of_beverages.ipynb) | [Medium article](https://medium.com/@dmitriy.bolotov/the-thermal-decay-of-beverages-a-casual-overanalysis-0c9d863b861e)
