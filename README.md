# Data Science Projects

This repository contains code and analysis for a set of data science projects focused on modeling, visualization, and signal processing.

I write about the projects on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dmitriy.bolotov), and keep everything organized on [dbolotov.github.io](dbolotov.github.io).


## Projects
- **The Thermal Decay of Beverages: A Casual Overanalysis** üçµ: Real data and Newton‚Äôs Law of Cooling to compare how mugs lose heat over time.
